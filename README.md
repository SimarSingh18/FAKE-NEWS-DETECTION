# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION
Fake News Detection Using BERT
This project presents the development and deployment of a fake news detection system tailored to the Indian context. Utilizing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), the system is trained on a dataset of Indian news articles. The goal is to accurately classify news articles as 'fake' or 'real'. The model is deployed on Hugging Face, providing an accessible tool for real-time detection. The research highlights the importance of combating misinformation to safeguard public discourse and prevent social and economic fraud.
